<h1><a href="https://gsherm23.github.io/Web-Development-Portfolio/Dice%20Game/">Dice Game Project</a></h1>
<li> I created this project in my Udemy Web Development Course </li>
<li> A basic dice game that I created using simple Javascript, HTML, & CSS  </li>
<li> The rules are simple, refresh the page </li>
<li> If your number is higher than the computer's number you win or vice versa </li>
<li> There is also a draw option if both numbers happen to be the same </li>
