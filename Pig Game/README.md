<h1><a href="https://gsherm23.github.io/Web-Development-Portfolio/Pig%20Game/">Pig Game </a></h1>
<li> Created a game called Pig using simple CSS & Javascript</li>
<li> The rules of the game you roll the dice and then whatever you get will be added to your score</li>
<li> You can then either keep the points or roll again </li>
<li> If you roll a one you will lose all the points you have so far but not from your total score </li>
<li> Who ever gets to 100 wins the game </li>
